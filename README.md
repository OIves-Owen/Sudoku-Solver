# Sudoku-Solver
p5.js project for solving sudoku puzzles

Work in progress 

Currently upon reaching a non-obvious solution, the solver will make a single random guess.
If this does not lead to the correct, the sketch resets until a correct solution is found.
This is mostly successful for solving basic sudokus but will require more work to solve more complex puzzles.
